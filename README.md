---

## Installation

The `video-player` component is available via npm at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@morton-studio/video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@morton-studio/video-player).

You can install it using:

```sh
npm install @morton-studio/video-player
```

## Usage

Import and register the component in your JavaScript file:

```js
import { registerVideoPlayer } from 'video-player'
registerVideoPlayer()
// or registerVideoPlayer('my-video-player')
```

Then use it in your HTML:

```html
<video-player src="video.mp4"></video-player>
```

### Recommended: Install the YouTube API and Vimeo API

To enable the YouTube and Vimeo APIs, install the following packages in your project:

```html
<!-- YouTube iFrame API, if needed -->
<script src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"></script>
<!-- Vimeo API, if needed -->
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
```

You only need to include the YouTube API and Vimeo API if you plan to use the YouTube or Vimeo video sources. If you are only using self-hosted videos, you can skip this step.

The web component will automatically detect the video source and load the appropriate API if needed by looking on the Window object for `YT` or `Vimeo`.  If you do it yourself, the plugin will be able to use the API directly instead of loading it via the plugin.

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… Smart Video Source Detection

Automatically determines video type based on the `src` URL:

- YouTube URLs (incl. Shorts): `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...`, `https://youtu.be/...`, `https://youtube.com/shorts/...`
- Vimeo: `https://vimeo.com/...`
- Self-hosted: anything else (assumes direct video file)

### âœ… Responsive Aspect Ratios

Supports predefined aspect ratios:

- `16x9` (default)
- `4x3`
- `1x1`
- `9x16`

Use the `aspect-ratio` attribute:

```html
<video-player aspect-ratio="4x3"></video-player>
```

### âœ… Poster Image Support

Use a single image:

```html
<video-player poster="/images/poster.jpg"></video-player>
```

Or use multiple formats:

```html
<video-player posters='{
  "avif": "/images/poster.avif",
  "webp": "/images/poster.webp",
  "jpg": "/images/poster.jpg",
  "png": "/images/poster.png"
}'></video-player>
```

### âœ… Custom Alt Text for Poster

Use the `posteralt` attribute to improve accessibility:

```html
<video-player posteralt="Preview image for demo clip"></video-player>
```

### âœ… Optional Play Button Overlay

Adds a centered play icon on the poster frame:

```html
<video-player playbutton></video-player>
```

### âœ… Fullscreen Toggle Support

Use the `allowfullscreen` attribute:

```html
<video-player allowfullscreen></video-player>
```

### âœ… Normalized Events

The <video-player> component normalizes events across different video player implementations, ensuring a unified experience. Supported events include:

* `video-play`
* `video-pause`
* `video-ended`

Each event is dispatched with a `detail` object containing the following properties:

- `type`: The type of video service (e.g., `youtube`, `vimeo`, `self-hosted`).
- `src`: The source URL of the video.
- `currentTime`: The current playback time in seconds, if available.
- `duration`: The total duration of the video in seconds, if available.

This allows developers to handle events consistently, regardless of the underlying video player technology.

### âœ… Flexible Layout with `autosize`

Make the component stretch to fill its container:

```html
<video-player autosize></video-player>
```

This is useful inside `flex` or `grid` layouts.

## ðŸŽ¨ Custom Styles

You can customize the appearance of the play button using CSS variables:

```css
video-player {
  --play-button-bg: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);        /* Button background */
  --play-button-arrow: white;                 /* Triangle color */
  --play-button-bg-hover: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);  /* Background on hover */
}
```

These variables let you customize the style without modifying the component directly.

---

## â™¿ Accessibility

This component has built-in accessibility features:

- Poster images have customizable `alt` text.
- All clickable elements (poster, play button) are keyboard accessible via `Enter` and `Space` keys.
- The poster is focusable and labeled with `role="button"` and `aria-label`.
- Uses semantic `<button>` for the play overlay.
- `iframe` embeds include a `title` attribute for screen reader clarity.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Self-Hosted Video with Multiple Formats

Use the `sources` attribute (as a JSON string):

```html
<video-player sources='[
  { "src": "/video.mp4", "type": "video/mp4" },
  { "src": "/video.webm", "type": "video/webm" }
]'></video-player>
```
